# Music Learning Path Optimization and Knowledge Dissemination via Graph Neural Network

## Overview

This project explores the integration of advanced machine learning techniques, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), into educational frameworks with a focus on music education. By moving beyond traditional methods that rely on semantic and temporal dependencies, this approach aims to optimize learning progression and enhance long-term retention.

## Motivation

In the evolving computational landscape, effectively disseminating complex educational content — especially in domains such as music — remains a critical challenge. Existing methods often fall short in adapting to individual learning needs and in achieving efficient knowledge transfer.

## Proposed Solution

To address these challenges, we introduce:

- **Harmonic-Flow Network (HFN):** A novel graph neural network architecture that captures both the structural and subtle nuances of musical education content.
- **Melodic Adaptive Diffusion (MAD):** A dynamic strategy that adapts content dissemination based on personalized learner profiles and feedback, leading to more effective and customized knowledge delivery.

## Key Contributions

- **Graph-Based Learning Optimization:** Utilizing graph structures to model and improve music learning trajectories.
- **Semantic-Aware Dissemination:** Balancing semantic relevance with personalization to enhance content retention and engagement.
- **Empirical Validation:** Demonstrating improved learning outcomes through experimentation with semantic retention and learning path modeling.

## Applications

- Personalized music education systems  
- Intelligent tutoring systems for the arts  
- Graph-based adaptive learning platforms
